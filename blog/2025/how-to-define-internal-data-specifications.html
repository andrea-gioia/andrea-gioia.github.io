        <div class="abstract-box">
            <p>In the world of data, we have plenty of specifications — but surprisingly few standards. SQL is one of
                the rare success stories, a standard that has saved countless resources over the years thanks to its
                interoperability. But beyond SQL, widely adopted standards are scarce, and this gap poses a major
                challenge for the entire ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>Why is this happening? And what can we do to change it? In my next post, I’ll explore ways to foster new
                standards in the data space. But first, let’s take a step back. What makes a good data specification?
                And how can you build one from scratch within your organization? In this post, I’ll break down the key
                elements of an effective specification and share practical steps to create one.

            <h2>What Is a Specification Anyway?</h2>

            <p>A specification is a formal and unambiguous description of an entity of interest, either an object or a
                process, that provides all and only the necessary information for its design, development, and/or
                operational use.</p>

            <p>A specification can be either public or private. A public specification is considered open when its
                evolution isn’t controlled by a single organization but is shaped by multiple organizations through
                clear and inclusive governance rules.</p>

            <p>A standard is an open specification that multiple organizations within a shared ecosystem widely adopt.
                It is typically recognized by a standardization body that oversees its evolution through a collaborative
                and transparent process.</p>


            <h2>What Is a Specification Anyway?</h2>

            <p>A <strong>specification</strong> is a formal and unambiguous description of an entity of interest, either
                an object or a process, that provides all and only the necessary information for its design,
                development, and/or operational use.</p>

            <p>A specification can be either public or private. A <strong>public specification</strong> is considered
                <strong>open</strong> when its evolution isn’t controlled by a single organization but is shaped by
                multiple organizations through clear and inclusive governance rules.
            </p>

            <p>A <strong>standard</strong> is an open specification that multiple organizations within a shared
                ecosystem widely adopt. It is typically recognized by a standardization body that oversees its evolution
                through a collaborative and transparent process.</p>

            <h2>Why Internal Data Specifications Matter</h2>

            <p>Data specifications are fundamental to ensuring that a data solution or data product is built correctly,
                meets expectations, and remains easy to use and maintain over time. In many ways, they represent the
                highest form of <strong>global governance policies</strong>.</p>

            <p>Their importance grows in complex data ecosystems where multiple independent entities operate in a
                distributed manner, often with different — or even conflicting — goals. In these environments, shared
                specifications serve as the <strong>rules of the game</strong>, imposing certain constraints on
                individual actors in exchange for smoother collaboration and a more sustainable evolution of the entire
                data ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Even without widely accepted <strong>data standards</strong>, defining <strong>internal data
                    specifications</strong> can be highly valuable for an organization looking to govern its
                <strong>data ecosystem</strong> — especially when adopting a <strong>data-as-a-product</strong> paradigm
                or embracing <strong>data mesh</strong> principles.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Get Started</h2>

            <p>When defining an internal specification, the first step is to clearly understand <em>what</em> you are
                describing and <em>why</em> it needs to be defined. Once that’s established, the next step is
                determining who should be involved in the process.</p>

            <p>Internal specifications are best developed in a <strong>collaborative</strong>, <strong>federated
                    approach</strong>, actively involving representatives from all impacted groups rather than imposing
                them from the top down. Even within an organization, a specification only makes sense if it is actually
                used — and the best way to ensure adoption is to engage stakeholders in its creation.</p>

            <p>Defining an internal specification doesn’t always mean starting from scratch — in fact, quite the
                opposite. Once the <strong>what</strong> and <strong>why</strong> are clear, it’s crucial to carefully
                consider the <strong>how</strong>. This involves assessing whether existing external specifications
                already meet the identified requirements. While no external specification will perfectly fit every
                organization’s needs, it’s important to weigh the <strong>trade-offs</strong> between adapting an
                existing one and building a new specification from the ground up.</p>

            <p>Once a shared decision is reached, it should be documented for future reference through a
                <strong>governance decision record</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>If there are strong reasons not to reuse an existing specification, it’s time to move forward with
                designing an internal <strong>custom specification</strong>. Let’s explore how.</p>

            <h2>Designing Your Own Data Specification</h2>

            <p>Specifications can be broadly categorized into two types, depending on the entity being described:
                <strong>object specifications</strong> and <strong>protocol specifications</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>An <strong>object specification</strong> outlines the attributes, properties, behaviors, and constraints
                of an object (e.g., <a href="https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/" target="_blank">Data Product Descriptor
                    Specification</a>). A <strong>protocol specification</strong>, on the other hand, defines the rules
                and formats that different actors must follow to communicate with one another (e.g., <a
                    href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/" target="_blank">Open Telemetry
                    Protocol</a>).</p>

            <p>In short, <strong>object specifications</strong> describe the components of a system, while
                <strong>protocol specifications</strong> explain how these components interact.
            </p>

            <p>In this blog post, we’ll focus on defining an <strong>object specification</strong> in the data context.
                Object specifications are simpler, something I’m quite familiar with from writing several of them, and
                they often serve as the foundation for more complex <strong>protocol specifications</strong>.</p>

            <p>An object specification should clearly and unambiguously define how to describe the object of interest.
                In my experience, this can be achieved by defining the following three key elements in the
                specification:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>🗺️ A Metamodel</li>
                <li>📜 A Schema Definition Language (SDL)</li>
                <li>📚 Schema Annotation Vocabularies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let’s take a closer look at each of these.</p>

            <h3>🗺️ A Metamodel</h3>

            <p>A <strong>metamodel</strong> is a model that defines the structure, rules, and constraints for creating
                other models. It serves as a blueprint to outline the basic structure of the object the specification is
                intended to describe.</p>

            <p>Here is a simple metamodel that could be used in a specification designed to describe data assets with a
                tabular structure.</p>

            <img class="normal-image"
                src="https://github.com/andrea-gioia/TheDataJoy/raw/main/blogs/2025/b001-how-to-define-internal-data-specifications/images/2025-B001-01-data-joy-spedicication-metamodel.png"
                alt="The Data Joy Specification Metamodel">

            <p>As shown in the image, a tabular data asset can be modeled using a <code>Table</code> object, which has a
                name and a list of <code>Column</code> objects. Each <code>Column</code> object has a name and a data
                type, which can be one of the following: <code>BOOLEAN</code>, <code>INT</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>,
                <code>STRING</code>, or <code>DATE</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>📜 A Schema Definition Language (SDL)</h3>

            <p>A <b>Schema Definition Language (SDL)</b> is a formal language used to describe a model that is
                an instance of a specific metamodel. In other words, the metamodel defines what can be described at a
                conceptual level, while the SDL provides practical guidelines for how to describe it.</p>

            <p>The following is an example of a BNF definition for an SDL that can be used to describe an instance of
                the metamodel for tabular data assets presented in the previous section.</p>

            <p>Most specifications don’t define their own SDL but instead reuse an existing one that is expressive
                enough to describe instances of the metamodel adopted by the specification. <a>JSON Schema</a>
                is one of the most widely used SDLs for this purpose, thanks to its expressiveness, ease of use, and the
                wide range of supporting tools available. The following is an example of a JSON Schema that can be used
                to describe instances of the metamodel introduced earlier for tabular data assets.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-json">

      "type": "string"
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$"
    },

            <p>The following is an example of a valid model instance described using the metamodel defined above and
                formally described using the previous JSON schema.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-json">
{
  "djs": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Employees",
  "columns": [

            <p>A JSON schema can also be used to validate model instances written in YAML. The following YAML instance
                of the metamodel, for example, is equivalent to the previous one in JSON.</p>

            <h3>📚 Schema Annotation Vocabularies</h3>
            <p>An <b>annotation</b> is a property that adds additional information to a model element. Each
                annotation consists of a keyword and an associated value. The <b>keyword</b> defines the
                meaning of the <b>value</b> used to enrich the annotated model component. The metamodel
                specifies which components can be annotated, while the SDL defines how to add the annotations.</p>

            <p>The following example demonstrates how to extend the SDL defined earlier in BNF to enable annotation of
                the <b>TABLE</b> and <b>COLUMN</b> elements of the metamodel.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-bnf">
&lt;table_definition&gt; ::= "TABLE" &lt;table_name&gt; &lt;annotations&gt; "{" &lt;column_definitions&gt; "}"

&lt;column_definitions&gt; ::= &lt;column_definition&gt; | &lt;column_definition&gt; "," &lt;column_definitions&gt;

&lt;column_definition&gt; ::= &lt;column_name&gt; &lt;data_type&gt; &lt;annotations&gt;

&lt;annotations&gt; ::= "[" &lt;annotation_list&gt; "]" | ε

&lt;annotation_list&gt; ::= &lt;annotation&gt; | &lt;annotation&gt; "," &lt;annotation_list&gt;

&lt;annotation&gt; ::= &lt;annotation_key&gt; "=" &lt;annotation_value&gt;

&lt;annotation_key&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt;
&lt;annotation_value&gt; ::= &lt;string_literal&gt; | &lt;number_literal&gt;

&lt;data_type&gt; ::= "INT" | "FLOAT" | "STRING" | "DATE" | "BOOLEAN"

&lt;table_name&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt;
&lt;column_name&gt; ::= &lt;identifier&gt;

&lt;identifier&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; &lt;identifier_tail&gt;
&lt;identifier_tail&gt; ::= &lt;letter_or_digit&gt; &lt;identifier_tail&gt; | ε
&lt;letter_or_digit&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt;
&lt;letter&gt; ::= "a" | "b" | ... | "z" | "A" | "B" | ... | "Z" | "_"
&lt;digit&gt; ::= "0" | "1" | ... | "9"

&lt;string_literal&gt; ::= '"' &lt;string_content&gt; '"'
&lt;string_content&gt; ::= &lt;character&gt; &lt;string_content&gt; | ε
&lt;character&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; | " " | "_" | "-" | "." | ":" | "/"

            <p>This is an example of an instance of the metamodel defined using the custom SDL based on the above BNF
                syntax, where each element is enriched with various annotations.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-sdl">
TABLE Employees [database="hr", phisycalName="EMPL"] {
    EmployeeID INT [phisycalName="ID", primaryKey="true"],

            </code></pre>
            <p>In JSON Schema, any keyword not used for validating the structure of a model instance is automatically
                treated as an annotation. Therefore, there’s no need to extend the schema to annotate its instances, as
                demonstrated in the following instance example.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-json">
            {

                  "primaryKey": "true"
                },

                },

                  "physicalName": "SALARY"
                },
                {

            }
            </code></pre>

            <p>Thanks to annotation, it is possible to clearly separate what in the description of the object of
                interest is structural and what is a descriptive property. By doing this, it becomes possible to
                describe the same object from multiple viewpoints. This makes the specification more flexible, easier to
                extend, and compatible with other specifications. It is probably the most important takeaway I have
                learned from writing specifications in the past couple of years.</p>

            <p>To use annotations effectively, the specification must not only define the metamodel and the SDL to
                describe it but also outline the allowable annotations and their definitions. Typically, the set of
                keywords used to annotate a model instance, along with their domain, range, and descriptions, is called
                a <b>vocabulary</b>.</p>

            <p>A specification may group annotations into different vocabularies based on their type. For example, the
                annotations used in the previous example could be logically organized into a vocabulary that defines all
                the keywords related to the physical system used to store and access the data asset.</p>

            <p>A vocabulary can be specified in various forms. In general, it should always include, for each keyword,
                its meaning (description), the type of accepted value (range), and the list of model elements to which
                it can be applied within the model instance (domain). Below is an example of a vocabulary that defines
                the keywords used earlier.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-json">
            {
              "vocabulary": "meta-physical",
              "keywords": {

                  "domain": ["TABLE","COLUMN"],

            <h2>Putting it all together</h2>

            <p>Once the metamodel, SDL, and supported schema annotation vocabularies are defined, the specification is
                ready. At this point, you can collect everything into a Git repository and release the first version.
