            <p>There’s a lot of buzz around data products these days, but no clear consensus on what the term actually
                means. As a result, it’s often used to describe entirely different things. Having just finished writing
                a book on how to manage data as a product, I’m thrilled to see the growing interest in the topic. But I
                also know the title <i>Managing Data as a Product</i> doesn’t give much away about what’s inside.
                Depending on
                how I define a data product, the 370 pages of the book might be exactly what you’re looking for — or
                completely off the mark. To save you the hassle of a potential Amazon return, let me use this blog post
                to explain what I talk about when I talk about data products.
            </p>

            <p>(with apologies to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html">Evan
                    Bottcher</a>)</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Products Are Software Applications</h2>

            <p>For me, a data product is essentially a software application. Like any software, it’s a unit of
                management made up of interfaces, code, data, and infrastructure. A dataset on its own, even with clear
                ownership and published on a marketplace for easy consumption, isn’t a data product by itself.</p>
            <p>However, not all software applications are data products. For an application to be considered a data
                product, it needs two key traits: it must be a product and offer functionalities directly driven by the
                data it manages. Let’s take a closer look at what these traits mean.</p>

            <img class="normal-image" src="./images/2025-B001-b001-data-products.png" alt="Data Productse">
            <div class="image-caption">Data Products</div>

            <p><b>A software application is a product when</b> it is developed following product management principles.
                Unlike applications built with a project-based approach, a product isn’t just about meeting a predefined
                set of requirements on time and budget (output). Instead, it focuses on solving a problem and delivering
                real value to users (outcome). Moreover, a product has an owner, and often a dedicated team, who drive
                its evolution over time, managing it through every stage of its lifecycle, from ideation to
                decommissioning.</p>
            <p><b>A software application is driven by data</b> when data isn’t just a by-product of its features but a
                key factor in shaping them. Transactional applications prioritize features, while the data they generate
                plays a secondary role. In contrast, a data product builds its features on top of the data it manages.
                Here, data comes first, driving the features and becoming a core part of the product.</p>
            <p>To summarize, this is my <b>definition of data product</b>:</p>

            <blockquote>A data product is a software application driven by data and developed following product
                management principles.</blockquote>


            <h2>Is a dashboard a data product?</h2>
            <p>Based on this definition, dashboards and ML models are data products, right? If they are developed
                following product management principles, my answer to this question is absolutely yes. However,
                analytical applications such as dashboards and ML models are not the only possible type of data product.
                There are also data products that expose just data in its pure form, without building specific features
                on top of it, except for those necessary to facilitate management, access, and consumption. These
                <i>pure
                    data products</i> are developed not to support a specific use case but to make a data asset easily
                reusable
                and composable with other data assets over time.
            </p>

            <div class="image-caption">Pure Data Products</div>

            <p>In my book <a
                    href="../../book/book.html">Managing
                    Data As A Product</a>, I focus on this specific type of data pure products, exploring how to design
                a socio-technical architecture that supports their development and sustainable evolution over time.
                Here’s my definition of a <b>pure data product</b>:
            </p>

            <blockquote>A pure data product is a modular unit within the data architecture, tailored to the cognitive
                capacity of the responsible team and developed following product management principles to make one or
                more data assets accurate, relevant, combinable, and readily usable for future value creation.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why care about pure data products?</h2>

            <p>Data is an asset that only holds value when it is used. Pure data products don’t directly use the data
                but instead make it accessible to other analytical and non-analytical applications, facilitating its
                use. This raises the question: what’s the point of focusing on this type of data product? Isn’t it
                enough to develop analytical applications that address high-value use cases for the organization and end
                users?</p>
            <p>My answer to this question is a clear NO. Without pure data products, each analytical application would
                have to reimplement all the necessary integrations to transform raw data into the correct format for
                developing its functionalities. As a result, every application becomes a data silo, where integration
                work — perhaps already done by other application applications— must be replicated from scratch, leading
                to obvious maintenance costs and the risk of misalignments.</p>
            <p>The end user cares only about the result. They don’t mind whether an analytical application reimplements
                integration logic from scratch or relies on pure data products that can be reused in the future. In most
                cases, they will likely prefer the option that allows the analytical application to be implemented more
                quickly. When there is no existing portfolio of pure data products, the fastest option is always to
                implement ad-hoc integrations for the use case directly within the application, rather than developing
                pure data products first and then building the analytical application on top of them. However, in the
                medium term, this approach to implementing new use cases becomes unsustainable, due to high maintenance
                costs and data quality issues arising from multiple copies of the same data integrated with different
                logic by each analytical application.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">Engineer To Order</div>

            <p>Pure data products are a way to rationalize integration work related to key data assets within the
                organization, making them available to support multiple use cases. Pure data products are building
                blocks that allow data to be managed sustainably over time, controlling maintenance costs and ensuring
                quality.</p>

            <img class="normal-image" src="./images/2025-B001-b004-compose-to-order.png" alt="Compose To Order">
            <div class="image-caption">Compose To Order</div>
            
            <p>Pure data products and analytical applications are equally important, and they don’t make sense without
                each other. As we’ve discussed, it’s not practical to have analytical applications without supporting
                pure data products (engineering to order), because the overall data architecture wouldn’t be sustainable
                in the long run. On the other hand, it also doesn’t make sense to have pure data products that don’t
                support any analytical applications (stock to order), since unused data is simply a non-productive cost.
                The right approach is to develop pure data products and analytical applications in tandem, following a
                use case-driven approach (compose to order).</p>

            <h3>Why care about pure data products?</h3>

            <p>Does it really make sense to call an application a product if it’s not directly used by business users?
                For me, the answer is yes. To be considered a product, it needs users who recognize its value and may be
                willing to pay to use it. A DBMS is a product, just like a BI tool, even though the latter is used
                directly by the business while the former is not. Similarly, a pure data product is a product, just like
                an analytical application. The users may differ, but all the elements that define a productare there
                (ownership, lifecycle, users, etc.).</p>
            <p>Moreover, a well-developed pure data product should make the data assets it manages as easy to
                understand, query, and use as possible, even for less technical users. A good pure data product should
                be usable by business users or even external customers.</p>

            <h2>Is a DWH or a DATA LAKE a pure data product?</h2>

            <p>ure data products act as a bridge between data producers and data consumers, creating a decoupling layer
                that allows integration work to be reused and shared. In essence, they do exactly what DWH and Data Lake
                have been doing for years. So, was it really necessary to introduce this new paradigm? Couldn’t a DWH
                and Data Lake simply be considered a pure data product?</p>
            <p>My answer to this question is NO. It’s true that a DWH, or a Data Lake, is a software application that
                provides data in its pure form, but size also matters. As stated in the definition, “a pure data product
                is a modular unit within the data architecture, tailored to the cognitive capacity of the responsible
                team”. </p>
            <p>DWHs and Data Lakes are typically monolithic applications, and their complexity quickly exceeds the
                cognitive capacity of the teams tasked with developing and maintaining them. This often leads to slower
                development and an accelerating growth of technical debt, until the system collapses under the weight of
                the complexity it created. It’s no coincidence that many organizations have had to rebuild their data
                platforms from scratch multiple times, following a rip-and-replace strategy. However, replatforming old
                systems replicating the same monolithic architecture has not solved the core issues related to
                sustainably managing the complexity generated. Creating a modular platform allows this complexity to be
                broken down into smaller, more manageable parts that can be handled by the development team, or teams.
                This is why pure data products mustn’t be so big to exceed the cognitive capacity of the development
                team.</p>

            <p>Data Lakes and DWHs are similar to monolithic transactional applications; they face the same problems in
                managing complexity. Instead, by leveraging the power of modularity, pure data products solve the
                problems of DWHs and Data Lakes, just as microservices solve the issues of monolithic transactional
                applications. </p>
            <p>In the transactional world, developing monolithic applications today is considered an antipattern. So,
                why do we think we can solve the problems of Data Lakes and DWHs by simply implementing more Data Lakes
                and DWHs? Isn’t doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results the definition
                of insanity?</p>


            <h2>Ok, ok… but why invent new terms?</h2>

            <p>Since I divide data products into two categories — those that expose features built on data and those
                that simply provide features to make the managed data easily reusable — I needed to introduce two terms
                to clearly identify them. Was it necessary? Probably not, but without it, I’d have to repeat the
                definition whenever I need to distinguish between the two categories of data products. For simplicity
                and convenience, I use the terms pure data product and analytical product. Of course, there are better
                names, but what matters are the concepts, not the names. The names are just a way to refer to the
                concepts. If you find a better term, feel free to use it, as long as we’re aligned on the meaning :)</p>

            <p><i>And that’s all I have to say about what a data product is. If my definition resonates with you and you
